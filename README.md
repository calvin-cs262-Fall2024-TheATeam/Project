# Centsible

Do you keep in track of how much you spent grocery shopping last week? What about the random $5 you spent buying a ticket for a Calvin event? 

With Centsible, you'll become sensible by keeping track of both your incomes and expenses. Sensitive notifications or alerts will remind you when budget goals are achieved, or even when you're about to pass the budget limit. Because at Centsible, we envision a world where every college student feels empowered and confident in easily managing their finances. 

Centsible is highly centered for college students, making it manageable to work with by only focusing on what you might need. By offering features such as real-time tracking of income and expenses, personalized spending insights, and monthly spending reports/trackings made into diagrams, Centsible will transform budgeting from a daunting, boring task into a manageable and even enjoyable experience!

In addition, the phrase 'to keep it simple, but not too simple' comes to mind. Other budgetting tools out there require a subscription or a payment, have complicated diagrams analyzing how much you've spent, or even becomes another task for you to manage. However, by prioritizing accessibility and user experience for college students, Centsible aims to be the go-to financial companion for students, helping them achieve their budgeting goals and build a foundation for a secure financial future!

Together, let's be Centsible!
